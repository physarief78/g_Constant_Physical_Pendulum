# g_Constant_Physical_Pendulum
Bandung Technology Institute Project

This project was made on purpose to measure the g constant from physical pendulum experiment. The measurement use color tracking approach in video frame where the physical pendulum that covered up by specific color is oscillating. The results still far from the literature, so i open this repo for discussion and correction.
